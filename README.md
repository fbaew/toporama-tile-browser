# Toporama Browser

I love maps. They are fun to look at and fun to use. Imagine my delight when I
learned about Toporama, a free online tool to browse the (also free) map data
provided by the Governmetn of Canada. Topographical maps of any part of the
country. Awesome!

Except the online browser is kind of ... bad. It is slow mainly because it does
not cache tiles whatsoever.

This is my effort to correct that.

# Status Quo

I'm in the exploratory stages here so I've been focusing on a little python
tool to work grab and subdivide map images.

# Roadmap

Once I have a good understanding of how to get the tiles I need, I will shift
my focus to implementing a Javascript tool for browsing maps and who knows what
else.
